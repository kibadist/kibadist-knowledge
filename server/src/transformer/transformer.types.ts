/* ===========================================================================
 * Article JSON v2 contract (DET-277) — the structured, typed-block evolution.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * WHY v2 exists. v1 (`SourcePreservingArticle` above) models a section as a flat
 * `ArticleParagraph[]`. The product needs richer, source-faithful structure:
 * lists, quotes, tables, code, pull-quotes, figure anchors and inline callouts,
 * nested subsections, heading provenance, and (in later waves) reading aids,
 * callout placement, genre shape, and audited reorderings. v2 captures all of
 * that as an ADDITIVE SUPERSET so a v1 article maps onto v2 losslessly.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT.
 *  - `schemaVersion: 'v2'` is the discriminator. Absence ⇒ legacy v1.
 *  - `mode` stays `'source_preserving_article'` (unchanged from v1).
 *  - A section's body is `blocks: ArticleBlock[]` (replacing v1 `paragraphs`),
 *    plus optional one-level `subsections`.
 *  - Heading provenance uses v2 naming `HeadingSourceV2`
 *    ('original' | 'cleanedOriginal' | 'inferred'); the adapter maps v1
 *    'original'→'original', 'light_reword'→'cleanedOriginal',
 *    'inferred_from_source'→'inferred'.
 *  - Top-level `abstract` stays `ArticleParagraph[]` (NOT blocks): it is summary
 *    matter, never carries lists/tables/figures, and keeping it as paragraphs
 *    keeps the v1→v2 adapter trivial (no abstract block-wrapping). End-matter
 *    (`keyTerms`/`sourceExamples`/`caveats`) and `originalStructure` are RETAINED
 *    verbatim from v1 — they are placement input for later waves and the compact
 *    end index.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT (unchanged from v1). Every represented fragment is traceable to
 * source blocks: every `ArticleBlock` carries a `sourceBlockIds` array (non-empty
 * for real source content). v2 widens the SHAPE of the article, never its
 * SUBSTANCE — no field here lets the AI add meaning the source did not contain.
 *
 * READ-TIME ADAPTATION. The server is the single adaptation boundary: stored v1
 * JSON is NEVER rewritten; `getArticle` adapts v1→v2 via `article-compat.util.ts`
 * (`toArticleV2`, idempotent, discriminated on `schemaVersion`) so the web only
 * ever sees v2. The generator keeps emitting v1 in this wave (DET-277); it emits
 * v2 natively from DET-271.
 *
 * FORWARD-RESERVED FIELDS. Optional top-level fields land in later waves but are
 * TYPED now so the contract is complete: `readingAids` (DET-274),
 * `calloutPlacements` (DET-272), `shape` (DET-273), `reorderings` (DET-275).
 * They are placeholder shapes — minimal but real — so schema tests can cover
 * them; their producers/consumers arrive in their waves.
